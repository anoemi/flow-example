# Example Flow Repository

This is an example flow repository, generated by following Flow's [getting started instructions][1].

To run flow, run `yarn` to install dependencies, then `yarn run flow`. It should report a type error in `src/example.js`.

To run the code, run `yarn build` and then run `node lib/example.js`. It will print the number 3 to console.
